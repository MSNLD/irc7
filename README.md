# IRC7
IRC7 Project

About:

Created & Maintained by [@jyonxo](https://github.com/jyonxo) and [@realJoshByrnes](https://github.com/realJoshByrnes)
msnld is hosted by @realJoshByrnes
irc7 is hosted by SkyCrest

This is the final iteration of a series of projects that began a few years before the close of MSN. The project has been contributed mainly by [@jyonxo](https://github.com/jyonxo) and [@realJoshByrnes](https://github.com/realJoshByrnes). The idea was to have a server that closely mimics what MSN Chat used to provide.

The project was initially created as a C# .NET Service but had undergone multiple iterations, it finally found its way to .NET Core which has gained a lot of traction in the industry and has multiple platform support so this can be targetted for Windows, Linux, MacOS etc.

The server is loosely based on a mixture of the following RFCs:

[RFC 1459](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459)

[draft-pfenning-irc-extensions-04](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-pfenning-irc-extensions-04)

Also our own data gathered during the time MSN Chat was operational, including eXonytes Realm & other sources

Current project state:

IRC7 uses .NET 8.0 and is compiled in VS 2022

Apologies as this is currently in early development so:
- Codebase is rough
- Not enough commenting
- Parts need re-writing/optimization
- Still WIP
